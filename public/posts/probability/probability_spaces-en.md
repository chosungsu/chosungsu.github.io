### Classes of Sets, Events, and Dynkin's $\pi$-$\lambda$ Theorem

Before introducing probability, we must clarify the notion of a sample space and events. The sample space is the collection $\Omega$ of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

Events must essentially be subsets of the sample space $\Omega$. However, in most practical scenarios $\Omega$ is infinite, and it is mathematically inappropriate to treat every subset of $\Omega$ as a legitimate event.

The key axiom for events is stability under natural set operations—events must be closed under these operations. If $A$ and $B$ are legitimate events, then $A^c$, $A \cup B$, and $A \cap B$ must also be legitimate events.

#### $\sigma$-Algebra

A collection $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ when it satisfies three properties.

Given a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$, the pair $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ is a measurable space. Elements of $\mathcal{F}$ are called $\mathcal{F}$-measurable sets and are interpreted as events.

A $\sigma$-algebra is closed under countable unions, intersections, complements, and any combination of these operations.

#### Elementary Classes of Sets

A $\pi$-system is closed under finite intersections ($A, B \in \mathcal{C} \implies A \cap B \in \mathcal{C}$).

A semiring is a $\pi$-system that contains $\emptyset$ and allows $A \setminus B$ to be expressed as a finite disjoint union of sets from $\mathcal{C}$.

#### Borel $\sigma$-Algebra

The $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ is called the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$ and is denoted $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$.

#### Dynkin's $\pi$-$\lambda$ Theorem

If $\mathcal{C}$ is a **$\pi$-system**, then the $\lambda$-system generated by $\mathcal{C}$ coincides with the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$.

$$
\lambda(\mathcal{C}) = \sigma(\mathcal{C})
$$

### Probability Measures and Basic Properties

For a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, a set function $\mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty]$ is called a measure when it satisfies:

$\Rightarrow$ $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$

$\Rightarrow$ For any sequence $\{A_n : n \ge 1\}$ of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathcal{F}$,

$$
\mu \left( \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)
$$

#### Basic Properties of Measures

Measures satisfy finite additivity for disjoint $A_1, \dots, A_n$ with $\mu(A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n) = \mu(A_1) + \cdots + \mu(A_n)$, monotonicity whenever $A \subseteq B$ implies $\mu(A) \le \mu(B)$, continuity from below when $A_n \uparrow A$, and continuity from above when $A_n \downarrow A$.

#### Probability Measure

A measure $\mu$ defined on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ is a probability measure when $\mu(\Omega) = 1$. Probability measures are typically denoted $\mathbf{P}$, and the triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})$ is a probability space.

Kolmogorov's three axioms are:

$\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{P}(A) \ge 0$

$\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{P}(\Omega) = 1$

$\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{P}$ is countably additive

### Construction of Probability Measures

#### Carathéodory's Extension Theorem

The core idea proceeds as follows.

Choose the sample space $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$ and the collection of events $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, the Borel $\sigma$-algebra. For the half-ring $\mathcal{C} = \{(a, b] : a \le b\}$, define a set function $\mu$ using the distribution function $F$:

$$
\mu((a, b]) \triangleq F(b) - F(a)
$$

There then exists an extension $\overline{\mu}$ that defines a measure on $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$. If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, the extension is unique and the extended measure $\overline{\mu}$ is also $\sigma$-finite.

#### Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure

The measure on $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ uniquely generated by a right-continuous nondecreasing function $F$ is called the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure induced by $F$ and is denoted $\mu_F$.

When $F(x) = x$, $\mu((a, b]) = b - a$ measures the length of the interval.

#### Distribution Function

In probability, a distribution function $F$ is a right-continuous nondecreasing function that satisfies

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = 0, \\
&\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = 1
\end{aligned}
$$
