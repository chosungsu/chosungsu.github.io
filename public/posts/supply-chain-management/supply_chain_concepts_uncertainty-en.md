### SCM's uncertainty

Taking the 2010 Icelandic volcanic eruption as an example, airports were closed, causing delays in electronic component shipments and production disruptions of 7,000 units at BMW, Nissan, and others. Additionally, in 2011, flooding in Thailand caused inundation at Western Digital's hard drive manufacturing plant and component manufacturing plants (clusters), leading to the closure of all Seagate plants. This resulted in a sharp decline in PC sales, causing Samsung Electronics' stock price to fall. Furthermore, during the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, there were factory shutdown crises at domestic automotive and semiconductor manufacturers, and Honda's UK factory experienced 50% production suspension for 7 weeks, causing disruptions in production plans.

In conclusion, demand forecasting is not the solution. This is because demand is not the only source of uncertainty.

Due to lean production and JIT (Just in Time), inventory has decreased, outsourcing has made response difficult, and off-shoring has made it difficult to synchronize work schedules with overseas outsourcing, requiring SCM to operate more complexly in modern times.

### Goal Conflicts Among Entities in the Supply Chain

Conflicts between departments within a company include goals, decision items, and performance indicators (KPIs). For example, in the purchasing department, the goal is to minimize purchase prices, decision items include lowest purchase prices, stable purchase requirements, multiple sourcing, frequent bidding, etc., and performance indicators can be viewed cost-orientedly as year-over-year changes in purchase prices. In the production department, the goal is cost minimization, decision items include long-term production of the same model, stable production scheduling, product standardization, etc., and performance indicators can be viewed cost-orientedly as unit production costs and production volume.

Looking at communication problems between sales/marketing and production planning departments, there's the case of Volvo's green car. In the mid-1990s, due to overproduction of green cars compared to demand, the sales/marketing department initiated discount sales to clear inventory. At this time, the production planning department, unaware of the discount sales situation, misjudged the situation, thinking that customers had finally started buying, and planned even more production.

Such lack of communication can cause major problems.

### Supply Chain Cost Analysis

Taking department stores as an example, if department store fees are set at 30-40% of sales revenue and overall employee costs are set at 10-20% of sales revenue, then 40-60% of department store selling prices should be viewed as costs arising from the retail stage of the department store.

So when a company hoping to enter calculates the costs of home shopping, if company fees are 40%, promotion costs for video and program production are 15%, and high return rates are 20-30%, these are costs that force withdrawal.

### Examples of SCM Potential

Walmart became the world's number one retailer through logistics system innovation. Additionally, P&G saved $65 million through logistics improvements that minimized the bullwhip effect. Dell's stock price increased by 3000% over 20 years along with computer performance improvements (direct transactions or build-to-order).

### Bake off system

While the typical bread manufacturing process is mixing -> 1st fermentation -> rounding -> shaping -> 2nd fermentation -> baking, the Bake off system is a method where shaped dough is flash-frozen and stored in a dormant state, then thawed just before sale, followed by 2nd fermentation and baking.

The development of this method has enabled mass production and supply of dormant dough.

### Competition between SCMs

Competition between neighborhood supermarkets and large corporate supermarkets (SSM, Super SuperMarket) has emerged as a social issue. This is because neighborhood supermarkets source from wholesalers or local supermarket cooperatives, while large supermarkets source from their corporate headquarters.

SSMs come in forms of directly operated stores, franchises (45% profit distributed to store owners), and voluntary chain stores. This represents a case where winning is difficult from the procurement process.

Dell implemented pull SCM rather than the push SCM typical of PC companies. While push SCM has the structural issue of always maintaining 60-70 days of inventory, pull SCM only maintains 5 days of inventory, allows for immediate prepayment upon order, and offers the advantage of customized individual orders.
