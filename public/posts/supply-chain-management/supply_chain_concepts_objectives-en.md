### Definition

SCM refers to the flow of products and services.

It can be thought of as a chain mostly consisting of source -> supplier -> converter -> distributor -> retailer -> consumer. What flows forward are products and services, while what flows backward are goods and information.

These chains are connected through logistics activities. And they are integrated through information, planning, and integration activities.

The Development chain is a collection of actions and procedures related to new product introduction, including all activities before mass production, and consists of product design stages, capabilities and knowledge required for development, manufacturing/purchasing decisions, production planning, etc. When diagrammed, it handles the chain that leads from plan/design -> source -> produce.

As examples, in the case of smartphone apps, when creating one app, cost transfer occurs from company's total profit cost -> intermediary (store) cost -> developer cost -> customer payment cost. Also, in the case of travel package tours, cost transfer occurs from local travel agency's total profit cost -> travel agency headquarters cost -> intermediary (agency) cost -> customer payment cost.

Looking at the value chain as shown in the image above, customers place orders through the website, and orders are automatically scheduled into the production system. Additionally, 70% of inquiry calls are designed not to be handled by humans.

Therefore, the definition of SCM can be considered as an approach that efficiently integrates to ensure products are produced and distributed in appropriate quantities, places, and times, with the goal of satisfying customer expectations while minimizing the total system cost.

### Definitions by Era

1970s: MRP -> Abbreviation for Material Requirement Planning, a manufacturing information management technique that integrates material supply planning and production management

1980s: ERP -> Abbreviation for Enterprise Resource Planning, a business resource integration management technique that covers the entire enterprise including production and sales within the company

1990s: SCM -> A management technique that solves the problem of excess inventory caused by lack of information sharing between producers and wholesalers/retailers to simultaneously achieve two conflicting goals (customer satisfaction and cost minimization)

### SCM Characteristics

All facilities that affect costs must be considered. And the overall system efficiency and cost-effectiveness must be considered.

Multi-level activities include a mix of strategic, tactical, and operational activities.

Geographically distributed and globalized supply chains have become complex, increasing SCM difficulty. It also has dynamic tendencies with time-based changes and mismatches between supply and demand.

Ultimately, problems arise because the goals of entities within the supply chain differ.

As an example from the United States, over $1 trillion is spent on logistics-related activities, which is over 10% of GDP, with transportation costs accounting for 58%, inventory costs for 38%, and management costs for 4%.

The phenomenon where small demand changes on the demand side of the supply chain cause large demand changes on the supply side due to order quantity variations is called the bullwhip effect.
