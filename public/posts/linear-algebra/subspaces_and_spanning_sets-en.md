### Subspaces

A subset $U$ of a vector space $V$ is called a subspace when $U$ is a vector space under the addition and scalar multiplication operations inherited from $V$.

Consider a plane $P$ passing through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The equation $ax + by + cz = 0$ can be expressed as a homogeneous system $\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = 0$ or as $MX = 0$ where the matrix is $M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \end{pmatrix}$.

If both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are solutions to $MX=0$, then by the linearity of matrix multiplication, $\mu X_1 + \nu X_2$ is also a solution.

$$
M(\mu X_1 + \nu X_2) \\ = \mu M X_1 + \nu M X_2 \\ = \mu 0 + \nu 0 = 0
$$

Therefore, $P$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. Also, $P$ contains the origin.

### Build subspaces

Consider the set $U = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. Since $U$ consists only of two vectors, it does not satisfy the condition that any constant multiple of these vectors must also be in $U$, so we can see that $U$ is not a vector space. For example, the zero vector is not in $U$, and $U$ is not closed under vector addition.

However, we know that two vectors define a plane. In this case, the vectors in $U$ define the $xy$-plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We can view the $xy$-plane as the set of all vectors generated by linear combinations of the two vectors in $U$. This set of all linear combinations is called the span of $U$.

$$
\text{span}(U) = \left\{ x \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \mid x, y \in \mathbb{R} \right\}
$$

For example, let $V$ be a vector space and let $S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots\} \subset V$ be a subset of $V$. The set denoted as $\text{span}(S)$, called the span of $S$, is as follows.

$$
\text{span}(S) := \\
\{ r^1 s_1 + r^2 s_2 + \cdots + r^N s_N \mid r_i \in \mathbb{R}, N \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$

That is, $\text{span}(S)$ is the set of all finite linear combinations of elements of $S$. And for any subset $S \subset V$, to show that $\text{span}(S)$ is a subspace of $V$, it is sufficient to show that $\text{span}(S)$ is closed under linear combinations.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& u = c_1 s_1 + c_2 s_2 + \cdots \\ 
& v = d_1 s_1 + d_2 s_2 + \cdots \\
& \lambda u + \mu v = (\lambda c_1 + \mu d_1)s_1 + (\lambda c_2 + \mu d_2)s_2 + \cdots
\end{aligned}
$$

Since this is a linear combination of elements of $S$, it belongs to $\text{span}(S)$.
Therefore, $\text{span}(S)$ is closed under linear combinations, and thus is a subspace of $V$.

An example of verifying closure is as follows.

$$
\text{span} \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -3\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}\right\} = R^3
$$

At this time, there are arbitrary vectors $r_1, r_2, r_3$ and we can make a linear combination: $r_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ a\end{pmatrix} + r_2 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -3\end{pmatrix} + r_3 \begin{pmatrix} a \\ 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z\end{pmatrix}$. In matrix form, this becomes $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & a \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \\ a & -3 & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\ r_2 \\ r_3\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z\end{pmatrix}$. If the matrix on the left is invertible, so that its inverse exists, then by computing the determinant $0 \ne \text{det} M = -(2a-3)(a+1)$, the span is 3-dimensional when $a \ne -1, \frac{3}{2}$.
