### Probability model

A probability model is a mathematical description of actual experiments that occur, consisting of three components: Sample space $S$, Event class $F$, and Probability assignment rule $P[\bullet]$.

$S$ is a set that collects the results of experiments, $F$ is a set that satisfies certain properties among the sets that collect subsets of $S$, and $P$ is a function that assigns probability values to each element of $F$.

For example, in an experiment of rolling a die once, $S$ is defined as $S=\{1, 2, \cdots, 6\}$, and if we want to find the set of subsets where even numbers appear, it can be defined as $F=\{x \in S : x \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\}=\{2, 4, 6\}$. And the probability can be calculated as $P=1/2$.

#### 1. Axiom of probability

$$
0 \le P[A] \le 1, \\
P[S]=1, \\
P[A \cup B] = P[A] + P[B]
$$

All probabilities basically have values greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. Also, the sum of probabilities for the entire set must be 1. Finally, when $A$ and $B$ do not occur simultaneously, the probability of having $A$ or $B$ can be obtained by adding their respective probabilities. This is because in $P[A \cup B]=P(A)+P(B)-P[A \cap B]$, the intersection is $\varnothing$.

#### 2. Sample space

When a random experiment is performed once, one outcome results. Different outcomes cannot occur simultaneously.

For example, for a probability model space regarding the angle of the position hit by shooting an arrow after spinning a disk marked with angles from 0 to 360, it is expressed as $S=\left[0, 360\right)$.

The number of elements (Cardinality of a set) is expressed as $|S|$, and in a closed set where all elements are listed, it is a finite case, and in a closed set where not all elements are listed, it can be said to be infinite and countable. In other cases, it is classified as infinite + uncountable. Also, countable cases can be expressed as discrete, and otherwise as continuous.

#### 3. Event class

The event class satisfies the following properties:

$$
\varnothing \in F, \\
A, B \in F \rightarrow A \cup B \in F, \\
A_1, A_2, \dots \in F \rightarrow \cup_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k \in F, \\
A \in F \rightarrow A^c \in F
$$

Such a set of subsets is called a $\sigma$-field.

For example, in the case of E1, if we consider the smallest event class $F$ containing event {1}, it becomes $F=\{\varnothing, \{1\}, \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, S_1\}$, and this is called generated by $\{1\}$. If it exists in the corresponding set, it is said to be measurable.

### Determining Probability Function by Counting

When a finite sample space is equiprobable, the probability function can be easily determined by counting.

$$
P[A]=\frac{|A|}{|S|}
$$

For example, when there are $n$ distinguishable balls in a bag, if we sample $k$ balls, with replacement extraction, we have a total of $n^k$ extraction counts. This can be expressed using the permutation symbol $n\mathfrak{p}k$. And if it's without replacement extraction, we have a total of $n(n-1) \cdots (n-k+1)$ extraction counts.

Factorials like $n!$ have values larger than $e^n$, where $e^n$ can be approximated as $e^n=1+n+\frac{1}{2!}n^2 + \frac{1}{3!}n^3 + \cdots$, and the factorial can be approximated as $\sqrt{2\pi}n^{n+\frac{1}{2}} e^{-n}$.

For sampling without replacement and without order, it can be calculated as $nC_k=\begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Finally, for sampling with replacement and without order, it can be calculated as $nH_k=\frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!(n-1)!}$.

### Conditional probability

When defining $P[A|B]$ for two events $A$ and $B$, this refers to the conditional probability of event $A$ occurring given that event $B$ has already occurred. When expressed as a formula, it is $\frac{P[A \cap B]}{P[B]}$, where the numerator uses the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ occurring. Additionally, expanding the numerator, it can also be written as $P[A \cap B]=P[A|B]P[B]=P[B|A]P[A]$.
